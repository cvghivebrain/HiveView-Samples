This is a selection of properly-sourced file samples in a variety of formats. Files are named according to the program or device that created them, followed by any specific formatting info in brackets. If the file came from a game, disc or other primary source (i.e. it's impossible to know how the file was made), its name is prefixed with an underscore.
